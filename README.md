Unofficial Unbounce Landing Page Variant Conversion Rate Calculator

Quickly calculate and compare Unbounce variant conversion rates against the Champion, focusing only on traffic during the variant's active period.

When a Champion has accumulated significant traffic, its conversion rate can overshadow new variants, making comparisons inaccurate. This Chrome extension automates the process by comparing only the traffic from the time each variant was launched, ensuring a fair comparison.

Instead of manual calculations, the extension instantly pulls and processes stats for up to 10 active variants, showing winners and losers directly on the Unbounce page. If a variant has fewer than 30 visitors, the result will show "ANALYZING" to indicate that more data is needed for a reliable comparison. You're able to adjust "30" in the Settings.

To ensure accurate calculations, include Champion Starting Visitors and Conversions in each variant's title, formatted like this:

Variant B - Title: Added large review widget | (1339.csV 52.csC
  
Variant C - Title: Added small review widget | (1221.csV 43.csC)

Remove commas from numbers and make sure the Champion Starting Visitors number is followed by a ".csV" and make sure the Champion Starting Conversions number is followed by a ".csC" for the calculations to be accurate.
