Calculate and compare Unbounce variant conversion rates against Champion.

Unofficial Unbounce Landing Page Variant Conversion Rate Calculator

When I have a Champion that has a lot of visitors and conversions, it becomes harder to get a quick glance at the actual variant stats compared to the Champion since the Champion stats are taking into consideration much more traffic than the newly created variant, thus making the Champion conversion rate listed non effective.

In order to get a more accurate picture of the comparison stats, you need to compare only the traffic to the Champion and the variants during the time of when the variant was created. For example, If the champion has been running for a month and I create a variant to split test against it today, I only want to compare today's traffic to both the Champion and the Variant from the time I launched the Variant today. Sometimes I launch multiple variants throughout the day, so looking at Unbounce's daily stats doesn't really give me accurate stats.

I was doing this math in a Google Sheet, but now I can have all of this math done instantly on the same page via this Chrome extension. Once the Chrome Extension is clicked, the extension automatically gathers all of the stats from the active variants (up to 10 active variants) on the Unbounce page and calculates them all and displays Winners and Losers instantly without having to type the data in manually and without having to do the math for each variant on a calculator. If the variant does not have 100+ visitors, the result will show "ANALYZING" so you know you need more visitors until you can start to get a good comparison rate.

In order for the Chrome Extension to properly calculate the Champion Starting traffic for each active variant, you need to include the Champion Starting Visitors and Champion Starting Conversions in the Variant's editable title like so:

Variant B - Title: Added large review widget | (1339.csV 52.csC)

Variant C - Title: Added small review widget | (1221.csV 43.csC)

Remove commas from numbers and make sure the Champion Starting Visitors number is followed by a ".csV" and make sure the Champion Starting Conversions number is followed by a ".csC" for the calculations to be accurate.
